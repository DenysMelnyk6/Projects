The task is to make ML algorithm that will predict the cost of a car depending on different info given about the car. 
To evaluate, the Percentage Mean Absolute Error(PMAE) will be used. 
The data given and all the data that will be requested is related to the Russian car market, so all the prices
are given in Russian currency(Russian Ruble), and some of the prices might be regional. 

The first model that will be tested is Naive Linear Regression. 
The second model that will be tested is Naive Random Forest Regression.
In any case, more advanced methodology such as bagging, stacking or boosting.
Most efficient hyperparameters will be found using grid search.


The dataset test.csv is going to be used for validation of the model on Kaggle.
Before the model can be tested, the data in test.csv needs to be cleared out.

The data for the training of the model will need to be found and either parsed from a third party website
or found on Kaggle. 

As of now, the project is done by one person.
